     * to DONE if done, add your name, and some comments if necessary to keep the 
     * list uptodate.

     * TODO: Clean up exception handling, remap to WSSecurityException, avoid generic Exception.
     * TODO: make Cipher provider configurable
     * DONE: new function to perform Certificate handover from request to response according to Kojira's
     *          explanation. Werner, checkin March, 24
     * TODO: Better texts for the Exception, see OASIS WSS specs for recommended fault strings
