Additions and fixes in release 1.1.1:
- to allow applications to use multiple Saga implementations within a single
  application, all factory methods now also have versions that have as first
  parameter the name of the SagaFactory class to be used. While this change does
  not affect existing applications that don't use this feature, it DOES affect
  Saga implementations: they may no longer use the default SagaFactory class.
  Saga implementations now must use versions that specify their own SagaFactory
  implementation, because the default (set by the application or user)
  may indicate another Saga implementation.
- one of the IOVec factory methods still did throw NotImplemented, which it should
  not.
- there was a small error in the javadoc of TaskContainer, which made the
  page display as an empty page on sites that pass pages through PHP.

Most of the additions and fixes in release 1.1 are prompted by the
recent changes in the SAGA specifications.

Additions and fixes in release 1.0.1 with respect to release 1.0:

  added by Steve Fisher and Antony Wilson.
- the org.ogf.sage.url.URL interface now extends org.ogf.saga.SagaObject,
  as it should.
- org.ogf.saga.task.Task: rethrow() can now also throw SagaIOException, because
  it may be thrown by the method of which a task version was executed.
- the org.ogf.saga.rpc.Parameter interface now extends org.ogf.saga.SagaObject,
  as it should.
- org.ogf.saga.namespace.NSEntry: isDir(), isEntry(), isLink(), readLink()
  do not throw BadParameterException.
- org.ogf.saga.namespace.NSDirectory:
    permissionsDeny(String target, String id, int permissions, int flags) and
    permissionsDeny(String target, String id, int permissions) 
  can now also throw IncorrectStateException.
- org.ogf.saga.monitoring.Steerable: addMetric(Metric) and removeMetric(Metric)
  can now also throw IncorrectStateException.
- org.ogf.saga.bootstrap.SagaFactory: createRPCFactory() can now throw
  NotImplementedException.
- org.ogf.saga.bootstrap.SagaFactory: now also contains a method createSDFactory()
  for the service discovery package.
- org.ogf.saga.attributes.Attributes now contains a method 
  boolean existsAttribute(String key), which apparently was added to the

  of this method.
