	<p>
	This overview discusses some of the general, Java-specific design
	considerations for the classes and interfaces from the
	language-independent SAGA specification (GFD.90).
	</p>

	<h2>Java language version</h2>

	<p>
	The Java language version used is the one provided in J2SE 5.0
	This version of the Java language is widely available and,
	in contrast to earlier versions, this version provides generics and
	enumerated types, features used in the SAGA language bindings
	for Java.
	Also, this version provides the {@link java.util.concurrent}
	package, which is not available in earlier versions, and which is
	used for the Java language bindings of SAGA tasks.
	</p>

	<h2>Identifiers</h2>

	<p>
	Various identifiers as used in the language-independent SAGA
	specification are changed slightly to obey Java conventions
	(for instance, <code>set_data</code> became <code>setData</code>,
	enumeration literals are completely capitalized)
	or to avoid conflicts with already existing method names
	(<code>wait</code> is replaced by <code>waitFor</code>).
	</p>

	<h2>Concurrency control and thread-safety</h2>

	<p>
	Java SAGA implementations must be thread-safe. Multiple application
	threads are allowed to access a common SAGA object. However, no
	particular order is enforced, unless the application itself does so.
	</p>

	<h2>File I/O and Java file streams</h2>

	<p>
	Earlier experience with JavaGAT
	has shown that having implementations of
	the Java streams {@link java.io.InputStream} and
	{@link java.io.OutputStream} is very much appreciated by
	Java application programmers, since these
	are the types on which most Java I/O is based. Therefore, it
	was decided to add specifications for
	{@link org.ogf.saga.file.FileInputStream FileInputStream} and
	{@link org.ogf.saga.file.FileOutputStream FileOutputStream}
	to the file package.
	The {@link org.ogf.saga.file.File File} class as specified in the
	SAGA specifications is also specified in the Java language bindings.
	Of course, implementations and factories
	may throw the
	{@link org.ogf.saga.error.NotImplementedException NotImplementedException}
	exception when methods or complete classes cannot be implemented.
	</p>

	<p>
	Also, methods were added to {@link org.ogf.saga.stream.Stream Stream}
	to obtain the usual java IO streams.
	</p>

	<h2>Error handling</h2>

	<p>
	The SAGA specifications refer to POSIX error return codes for several
	methods. However, it is not to be expected that these will be available
	in existing Java Grid middleware. Also, in Java, error conditions are
	supposed to be passed on by means of exceptions. Therefore, it was
	decided that where the SAGA specifications refer to POSIX error codes,
	a {@link org.ogf.saga.error.SagaIOException SagaIOException}
	is to be thrown in these cases. If an error code is available,
	it is stored in the exception object.
	</p>

	<h2>Features unavailable in Java: permissions, links</h2>

	<p>
	For some features of the SAGA specifications, most notably permissions
	and links, Java just does not provide building blocks, even locally.
	Java is not a systems programming language.
	Nevertheless, all methods concerning links and permissions are specified
	in the Java language bindings. SAGA application writers should not be
	surprised, however, if SAGA implementations throw a
	<code>NotImplemented</code> exception when these methods are invoked.
	</p>

	<h2>Prescribing the API for applications and SAGA implementors</h2>

	<p>
	The aim of having bindings of the SAGA API specification to certain programming
	languages is to define the precise syntax and semantics of the SAGA
	functionality, in the given language. This language binding can be seen as
	a contract between applications and SAGA implementors: both parties can
	safely assume that exactly the classes and interfaces described in this
	document will be either provided or requested for.
	</p>

	<p>
	For facilitating both application writing and implementing SAGA,
	providing the Java language binding in the form of directly usable files
	is considered important. It has been decided to provide both interfaces and
	classes from the language-independent SAGA specification in the form of
	Java interfaces.
	This leaves SAGA implementations with the task of writing
	classes that implement these interfaces. For allowing applications to create
	SAGA objects, the interfaces are accompanied by factory classes.
	Java implementations of SAGA must implement the interfaces and factories
	as specified here.
	</p>

	<p>
	This setup requires a bootstrap mechanism for creating factory objects.
	This is realized with the
	{@link org.ogf.saga.bootstrap.SagaFactory SagaFactory}
	interface, and the
	{@link org.ogf.saga.bootstrap.ImplementationBootstrapLoader ImplementationBootstrapLoader} class, as described here.
	This mechanism uses the <code>saga.factory</code> system property,
	to be set by the user to point to an implementation-specific
	metafactory, which in turn has methods to create factories for all
	SAGA packages.
	</p>
