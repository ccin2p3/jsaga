    The job package describes the API for submitting jobs to a grid resource.
    It has four interfaces:
    {@link org.ogf.saga.job.JobDescription JobDescription},
    {@link org.ogf.saga.job.JobService JobService},
    {@link org.ogf.saga.job.Job Job}, and
    {@link org.ogf.saga.job.JobSelf JobSelf}.
    A {@link org.ogf.saga.job.JobDescription JobDescription} encapsulates
    a set of attributes that together describe a job that is to be submitted
    to a grid resource. A {@link org.ogf.saga.job.JobService JobService}
    is responsible for submitting the job. When a job is submitted
    successfully, a {@link org.ogf.saga.job.Job Job} is returned, which provides
    handles for monitoring, actually running, waiting for it to finish.
    Finally, a {@link org.ogf.saga.job.JobSelf JobSelf} represents an application
    instance running under the management of a resource manager. It is a job,
    but also implements the {@link org.ogf.saga.monitoring.Steerable Steerable}
    interface.

    <p>
    An important deviation from the language-independent SAGA specifications is
    that the {@link org.ogf.saga.job.JobService#runJob(String, String, boolean)
    JobService.runJob} method is specified differently:
    the input, output and error stream OUT parameters are not
    specified here, since Java has no OUT parameters. Unfortunately, their
    absence, according to the SAGA specifications, implies a non-interactive
    job. Since interactive jobs should still be supported, a parameter is
    added here to specify whether the job is interactive. If interactive, the
    streams can be obtained from the Job using the
    {@link org.ogf.saga.job.Job#getStdin() Job.getStdin},
    {@link org.ogf.saga.job.Job#getStdout() Job.getStdout}, and
    {@link org.ogf.saga.job.Job#getStderr() Job.getStderr} methods.
