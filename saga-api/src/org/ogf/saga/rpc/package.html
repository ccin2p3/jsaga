    The methods of the SAGA RPC package map with the methods as defined in
    the GridRPC specification, as described in GFD.52, at least semantically,
    with slight modifications for SAGA look and feel, SAGA error conventions,
    SAGA task model, et cetera.
    </p>
    <p>
	In contrast to the language-independent SAGA specifications, the
	{@link org.ogf.saga.rpc.Parameter Parameter} interface does not extend
	the {@link org.ogf.saga.buffer.Buffer Buffer} interface. The motivation
	for this is that most Java language bindings for RPC systems use
	{@link java.lang.Object} for parameters, implying that at least some
	types are serialized automatically. See, for instance, the Java bindings
	for Ninf-g and Apache XML-RPC.
