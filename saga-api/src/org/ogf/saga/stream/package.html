    The streams package provides a simple mechanism for setting up
    connections to remote components.
    </p>

    <p>
    The <code>Stream.wait()</code> method as described in the
    language-independent SAGA specifications is renamed to
    {@link org.ogf.saga.stream.Stream#waitFor(int) Stream.waitFor()},
    to avoid conflicts or confusion with {@link java.lang.Object#wait()}.
    </p>

    <p>
    Java programmers are used to {@link java.io.InputStream} and
    {@link java.io.OutputStream}. Therefore, a mechanism is provided
    to obtain such streams from a {@link org.ogf.saga.stream.Stream Stream}
    object (see
    {@link org.ogf.saga.stream.Stream#getInputStream() Stream.getInputStream()}
    and
    {@link org.ogf.saga.stream.Stream#getOutputStream() Stream.getOutputStream()}).
