    <p>
    The permissions package provides the interface
    {@link org.ogf.saga.permissions.Permissions Permissions}
    to query and set
    permissions on Saga objects, such as files or streams.
    Objects that implement this interface maintain a set of permissions
    for each object instance, for a set of IDs.
    </p>

    <p>
    The possible permission flags are defined in the
    {@link org.ogf.saga.permissions.Permission Permission} enumeration
    class, which includes methods to combine them into integers,
    and to determine if they are set in an integer.
    These methods are not described in the language-independent SAGA
    specification, but are added in the Java language bindings because
    in Java, enumerations cannot be treated as integers.
