    This package provides classes to manipulate namespaces.
    </p>
    <p>
    An {@link org.ogf.saga.namespace.NSEntry NSEntry} represents
    a namespace entry, and provides methods to inspect and manipulate
    this entry.
    </p>
    <p>
    An {@link org.ogf.saga.namespace.NSDirectory NSDirectory}
    represents a namespace entry that is a directory, and defines additional
    methods for them. A Java specific extension is that
    this interface extends <code>Iterable</code>, which allows
    an application to iterate over the entries in this directory, like this:
    <br>
    <code>
	for (URL url : directory) {...}
    </code>
    </p>

    <p>
    The possible namespace flags are defined in the
    {@link org.ogf.saga.namespace.Flags Flags} enumeration
    class, which includes methods to combine them into integers,
    and to determine if they are set in an integer.
    These methods are not described in the language-independent SAGA
    specification, but are added in the Java language bindings because
    in Java, enumerations cannot be treated as integers.
    Also, since enumeration classes are not extensible in Java, flags
    from the {@link org.ogf.saga.logicalfile logicalfile} package
    and the {@link org.ogf.saga.file file} package are included
    here as well.
