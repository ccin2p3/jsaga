<p>Provides interfaces to retrieve data from an information model.</p>

<p>A possible starting point for navigation would be a service, as
selected with the {@link org.ogf.saga.sd.Discoverer
org.ogf.saga.sd.Discoverer} API. Alternatively it is possible to start
with a selected entity type rather than a service. An optional filter
can be used to restrict the results returned. It is expected that this
Information System Navigator API will make use of various information
systems. The quality of the information returned will depend upon the
quality of the data in the back-end system or systems.</p>

<h2>Information Model</h2>

<p>This API can be used to navigate any information system that can
be represented as an entity relationship model.</p>

<h2>Classes</h2>

<p>This API has a {@link org.ogf.saga.isn.ISNFactory ISNFactory}
class for the creation of {@link org.ogf.saga.isn.EntityDataSet
EntityDataSet} objects.</p>

<p>The EntityDataSet class contains a set of {@link
org.ogf.saga.isn.EntityData EntityData} objects.The <code>EntityDataSet</code>
interface has three methods: <code>getData</code>, <code>listRelatedEntityNames</code>
and <code>getRelatedEntities</code>. The <code>getData</code> method
returns a list of objects of the <code>EntityData</code> class, with
each <code>EntityData</code> object representing an instance of an
entity as described in the GLUE entity relationship model. The <code>listRelatedEntityNames</code>
method returns a list of names of entities for use with the <code>getRelatedEntities</code>
method, with the names represent the entities, in the GLUE entity
relationship model, that can be navigated to from the current entity.
The <code>getRelatedEntities</code> method returns an object of the <code>EntityDataSet</code>
class, filtered according to a specified filter (see below).</p>

<p>The <code>EntityData</code> class implements the {@link
org.ogf.saga.attributes.Attributes org.ogf.saga.attributes.Attributes}
interface giving <i>ReadOnly</i> access to all the key names and values
in the <code>EntityData</code> object.</p>

<a name="filters">
<h2>Filters</h2>
</a>
<p>Both the constructor for the <code>EntityDataSet</code> and the <code>listRelatedEntityNames</code>
method take a filter string as an argument. This filter string is used
to restrict the set of entities returned. The filter MUST only include
attributes from the named entity for the constructor or from the related
entity for the <code>listRelatedEntityNames</code> method. The filter
strings uses SQL92 syntax as if it were part of a <code>WHERE</code>
clause acting to select from a single table. SQL92 has been chosen
because it is widely known and has the desired expressive power.
Multi-valued attributes are treated as a set of values.</p>
<p>Only the following operators are permitted in expressions not
involving multi-valued attributes: <code>IN</code>, <code>LIKE</code>, <code>AND</code>,
<code>OR</code>, <code>NOT</code>, <code>=</code>, <code>&gt;=</code>, <code>&gt;</code>,
<code>&lt;=</code>, <code>&lt;</code>, <code>&lt;&gt;</code> in addition
to column names, parentheses, column values as single quoted strings,
numeric values and the comma. For a multi-valued attribute, the name of
the attribute MUST have the keyword <code>ALL</code> or <code>ANY</code>
immediately before it, unless comparison with a set literal is intended.
For each part of the expression, the attribute name MUST precede the
literal value. An implementation SHOULD try to give an informative error
message if the filter string does not conform.</p>
<dl>
	<dt>The <code>LIKE</code> operator matches string patterns:</dt>
	<dd><code>'%xyz'</code> matches all entries with trailing xyz</dd>
	<dd><code>'xyz%'</code> matches all entries with leading xyz</dd>
	<dd><code>'%xyz%'</code> matches all entries with xyz being a
	substring</dd>
</dl>
<p>The <code>ESCAPE</code> keyword can be used with <code>LIKE</code>
in the normal way.</p>
<p>Column names are not case sensitive but values are.</p>
<p>No use-case has been identified for the operators <code>&gt=</code>,
<code>&gt;</code>, <code>&lt;=</code>, <code>&gt;</code> to be applied
to strings. An Implementation wishing to support these comparison
operators on strings MUST select a collation sequence. Alternatively, an
implementation CAN treat all string comparisons as true, or reject them
as invalid SQL.</p>

<h2>Details</h2>

<p>This API will typically use some underlying information system.
It may try to use an underlying information system but not be able to
access it. The precise behaviour is implementation dependent - for
example if it uses adapters it may try a different one. If no result can
be returned because of information system or other internal problems, it
SHOULD throw the {@link org.ogf.saga.error.NoSuccessException
org.ogf.saga.error.NoSuccessException} exception.</p>
