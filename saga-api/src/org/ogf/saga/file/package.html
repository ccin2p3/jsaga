    This package provides classes to manipulate the contents of directories
    or files. In addition to the classes described in the language-independent
    SAGA specifications, this package also contains classes that are
    extensions of {@link java.io.InputStream} and {@link java.io.OutputStream}.
    These are specific for the Java language bindings and were added because
    Java programmers are used to them and the Java libraries have various
    classes that build on top of these,
    </p>
    <p>
    A {@link org.ogf.saga.file.File File} represents
    an open file descriptor for read/write operations on a physical file.
    A deviation from the language-independent SAGA specifications is that
    the read and write methods do not return POSIX error codes in case
    of an error. Instead, they throw a
    {@link org.ogf.saga.error.SagaIOException SagaIOException}. If a
    POSIX error code happens to be available, it is stored inside the
    exception object.
    </p>
    <p>
    An {@link org.ogf.saga.file.Directory Directory}
    extends an {@link org.ogf.saga.namespace.NSDirectory NSDirectory}
    with methods to open files and other directories.
    Some methods have been renamed slightly to avoid conflicts with methods
    in {@link org.ogf.saga.namespace.NSDirectory NSDirectory}, as only
    the type of the return value differs, and Java forbids that.
    </p>

    <p>
    The possible file flags are defined in the
    {@link org.ogf.saga.namespace.Flags} enumeration
    class, which includes methods to combine them into integers,
    and to determine if they are set in an integer.
    These methods are not described in the language-independent SAGA
    specification, but are added in the Java language bindings because
    in Java, enumerations cannot be treated as integers.
    Also, since enumeration classes are not extensible in Java, flags
    from the {@link org.ogf.saga.logicalfile logicalfile} package
    and the {@link org.ogf.saga.namespace namespace} package are included
    there as well.
