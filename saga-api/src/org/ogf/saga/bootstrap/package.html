<p>
This package contains the bootstrap mechanism which connects a SAGA
application, written on top of the SAGA Java language bindings, to
a specific SAGA implementation.
</p>

<p>
The setup requires a bootstrap mechanism for creating factory objects.
This is realized with the
{@link org.ogf.saga.bootstrap.SagaFactory SagaFactory}
interface, and the
{@link org.ogf.saga.bootstrap.ImplementationBootstrapLoader ImplementationBootstrapLoader} class.
This mechanism uses the <code>saga.factory</code> property,
to be set by the user to point to an implementation-specific
metafactory, which in turn has methods to create factories for all
SAGA packages.
</p>

<p>
A mechanism is included to provide properties by means of a configuration
file called <code>saga.properties</code>, which is looked for in the
classpath, and in the current directory. Also, properties can be passed
on by means of the usual Java System properties.
