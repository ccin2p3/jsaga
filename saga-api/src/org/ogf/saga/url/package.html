    The methods of the SAGA URL package allow access to the parts of an URL.
    </p>

    <p>
    SAGA provides its own URL interface, because the java.net.URL class
    has various unwanted side effects, and having an interface and factory
    allows SAGA implementations to provide their own URL implementation.
    </p>

    <p>
    A deviation from the SAGA specifications is that none of the methods
    throw NotImplementedException. Only the factory method to create an
    URL object can throw it. This makes the methods easier to use, but
    obligates implementations to either implement the URL interface
    completely, or not at all.
