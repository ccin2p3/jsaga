Each SAGA API call has an associated list of exceptions it may
throw, which are described in this package.
These exceptions all extend the
{@link org.ogf.saga.error.SagaException SagaException} class.
</p>

<p>
Since Java has excellent exception handling support, the Java language
bindings use the Java mechanism instead of the <code>error_handler</code>
interface as described in the language-independent SAGA specification.
The language-independent SAGA specification specifies that in languages
with exception-handling mechanisms, such as Java, C++ and Perl,
the language binding may allow exceptions to be thrown.
If an exception handling mechanism is included in a language
binding, the <code>error_handler</code> must not be included in the same
binding.
</p>

<p>
The SAGA specifications say that
in languages bindings where this is appropriate,
some API methods return POSIX <code>errno</code> codes for errors.
For Java, this is not appropriate. The "usual" Java <code>read</code>
and <code>write</code> methods throw an exception when an error occurs.
The Java language binding versions of these SAGA API methods throw an
{@link org.ogf.saga.error.SagaIOException SagaIOException} when an error occurs.
If a specific error code is available, it can be examined through
the {@link org.ogf.saga.error.SagaIOException#getPosixErrorCode() getPosixErrorCode()} method.
</p>

<p>
The {@link org.ogf.saga.error.SagaIOException SagaIOException}
is specific for the Java Language Bindings for SAGA.
In the ordering of SAGA exceptions, as discussed in the language-independent
SAGA specification, the
{@link org.ogf.saga.error.SagaIOException SagaIOException}
is considered almost the most specific, inbetween
{@link org.ogf.saga.error.NotImplementedException NotImplementedException} and
{@link org.ogf.saga.error.IncorrectURLException IncorrectURLException}.
</p>

<p>
The layout of the result of
{@link org.ogf.saga.error.SagaException#getMessage() getMessage()}
deviates from that as specified in the language-independent SAGA specification.
The usual Java convention is followed instead. To obtain a result as required
by the language-independent SAGA specification,
{@link org.ogf.saga.error.SagaException#toString() toString()}
can be used, again as usual in Java.
</p>

<p>
A simple mechanism exists for storing and examining exceptions that may be thrown
by adaptors in adaptor-based Saga implementations. In such implementations, the
top-level exception (the one highest up in the Saga exception hierarchy) is not
always the most informative one, and the implementation is not always capable
of selecting the most informative exception. In these cases, the implementation
may opt to add the individual exceptions as nested exceptions to the exception
thrown.
