<p>
This package contains the base object for almost all SAGA objects.
The language-independent SAGA specification names this object "object",
which according to the Java conventions would become "Object".
To avoid confusion with {@link java.lang.Object}, we opted to name
this base object "SagaObject".

<p>
The <code>ObjectType</code> as specified in the language-independent
SAGA specification is not included in the Java language bindings.
Instead, the <code>instanceof</code> operator is to be used.
