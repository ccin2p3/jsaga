    The monitoring package defines the
    {@link org.ogf.saga.monitoring.Monitorable Monitorable} interface,
    which must be implemented by monitorable SAGA objects, and also
    defines the 
    {@link org.ogf.saga.monitoring.Steerable Steerable} interface,
    which extends the monitoring mechanism with the ability to push
    values back to the monitored entity.

    <p>
    Interfaces that extend {@link org.ogf.saga.task.Async Async} and also should
    extend {@link org.ogf.saga.monitoring.Monitorable Monitorable}, should
    extend {@link org.ogf.saga.monitoring.AsyncMonitorable AsyncMonitorable}
    instead, as that provides the task versions of the methods in
    {@link org.ogf.saga.monitoring.Monitorable Monitorable} as well.
