    This package provides classes to interact with replica systems.
    No specific consistency model is impied by the SAGA API specification.
    A {@link org.ogf.saga.logicalfile.LogicalFile LogicalFile} represents
    an entry in a namespace which administers a set of registered replicas
    of a specific file.
    A {@link org.ogf.saga.logicalfile.LogicalDirectory LogicalDirectory}
    represents a directory entry in the namespace of logical files, that is,
    it is a container for logical files.
    Some methods in this interface have been renamed slightly to avoid
    conflicts with methods in
    {@link org.ogf.saga.namespace.NSDirectory NSDirectory}, as only
    the type of the return value differs, and Java forbids that.
    </p>

    <p>
    The possible logicalfile flags are defined in the
    {@link org.ogf.saga.namespace.Flags} enumeration
    class, which includes methods to combine them into integers,
    and to determine if they are set in an integer.
    These methods are not described in the language-independent SAGA
    specification, but are added in the Java language bindings because
    in Java, enumerations cannot be treated as integers.
    Also, since enumeration classes are not extensible in Java, flags
    from the {@link org.ogf.saga.namespace namespace} package
    and the {@link org.ogf.saga.file file} package are included
    there as well.
