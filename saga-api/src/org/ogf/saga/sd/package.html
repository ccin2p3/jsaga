<p>This API provides a mechanism to locate services.</p>

<p>It is expected that this Service Discovery API will make use of
various information systems or other service discovery mechanisms. The
quality of the information returned will depend upon the quality of the
data in the back-end system or systems.</p>

<h2>Service Model</h2>

<p>This API is based upon the GLUE (version 1.3) model of a service.
This service model is also compatible with GLUE 2.0. A <i>Site</i> may
host many <i>Services</i> and a <i>Service</i> has multiple <i>ServiceData</i>
entries associated with it. Each <i>ServiceData</i> entry is represented
by a key and a value, thus allowing any set of keyword/value pairs to be
associated with an instance of a <i>Service</i>. In addition, a <i>Service</i>
has a many-to-many relationship with itself. This allows the model to
describe groupings of services.</p>

<p>It is possible that this Service Discovery API may be
incompatible with a future version of GLUE. This issue will be
addressed, if necessary, in a future revision of this API.</p>

<h2>Classes</h2>

<p>This API has a {@link org.ogf.saga.sd.SDFactory} class for the
creation of {@link org.ogf.saga.sd.Discoverer} objects. There are two
optional arguments for creating a <code>Discoverer</code>, {@link
org.ogf.saga.session} and {@link org.ogf.saga.url}. The URL is to assist
the implementation to locate the underlying information system such that
it can be queried.</p>

<p>The <code>Discoverer</code> class has a single method: <code>listServices</code>.
This method returns a list of objects of the {@link
org.ogf.saga.sd.ServiceDescription} class, filtered according to several
specified filters.</p>

<p>The <code>ServiceDescription</code> class has three methods. One
of these, <code>getUrl</code>, is all that most people will use to
obtain the address registered for the service. In the case of a Web
Service, this will be the service endpoint. It also implements the
{@link org.ogf.saga.attributes.Attributes
org.ogf.saga.attributes.Attributes} interface, and thus exposes
additional <i>ReadOnly</i> properties of the service, such as its type
and uid. These might be used by those who wish to generate a web page of
services, or need detailed information for other purposes. There is a
method <code>getRelatedServices</code> that returns the set of related <code>ServiceDescription</code>
objects, which represent related services. Finally, there is a method <code>getData</code>
to access the set of further key value pairs. This method returns a
{@link org.ogf.saga.sd.ServiceData} object, which also implements the <code>org.ogf.saga.attributes.Attributes</code>
interface giving <i>ReadOnly</i> access to all the key names and values
in the <code>ServiceData</code> object.</p>

<p>By making the <code>ServiceDescription</code> implement the <code>org.ogf.saga.attributes.Attributes</code>
interface, and by referencing a separate <code>ServiceData</code> object
holding the key value pairs, potential key name clashes between the sets
of pre-defined and free-form attributes are avoided.</p>

<h2>Details</h2>

<p>This API will typically use some underlying information system
and should not contact the services to check their availability. The
user must expect that a service provided by the Service Discovery API
may not be available. Even if the API were to contact a service to
confirm its availability, by the time the user attempts to use that
service, it may have failed. Similarly the API cannot be guaranteed to
provide a complete set of matching services - it is the responsibility
of the implementation to apply any algorithm it chooses to return a set
of services.</p>

<p>The API may try to use an underlying information system but not
be able to access it. The precise behaviour is implementation dependent
- for example if it uses adapters it may try a different one. If no
result can be returned because of information system or other internal
problems, it SHOULD throw the {@link
org.ogf.saga.error.NoSuccessException
org.ogf.saga.error.NoSuccessException} exception. Note that an
implementation MAY choose to return search results from multiple backend
services. In the case of an adaptor based implementation, several
adaptors may get queried at once, and the results may be collated into a
single list, if the specified URL does not limit the range of usable
adaptors.</p>
