    This package provides classes to manage resources on remote grid/cloud systems.
    </p>

    <p>
    This API (named Resource Management API or RM-API) is an extension to the SAGA API.
    It allows to acquire (create or get) and release (delete) resources. Resources are of three
    types:
    <ul>
        <li>{@link org.ogf.saga.resource.instance.Compute Compute} resources: to submit jobs</li>
        <li>{@link org.ogf.saga.resource.instance.Storage Storage} resources: to store data<li>
        <li>{@link org.ogf.saga.resource.instance.Network Network} resources: to link compute(s) and storage(s)
    </ul>
    </p>

    <p>
    Acquiring, listing and releasing resources are operated by the {@link org.ogf.saga.resource.manager.ResourceManager ResourceManager}.
    </p>
