This package provides the {@link org.ogf.saga.buffer.Buffer Buffer}
interface.
In Java, arrays have a size that can be examined at run-time,
so the buffer creation methods in the Java language bindings
either specify a <code>size</code>, in which case the buffer is
implementation-managed, or a byte array, in which case the
buffer is application-managed.
