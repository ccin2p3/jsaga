    This package provides classes and methods for manipulating tasks and
    collections of tasks. Tasks get created by invoking methods that return a task,
    so there are no factory methods for them.
    A task has two generic type parameters: the type of the object that created
    the task, and the type of the return value of the task.
    Tasks can be stored in a {@link org.ogf.saga.task.TaskContainer TaskContainer}.
    However, since a task container should be able to contain any task
    (and even jobs), the generic type information gets lost.
    So, when a task is pulled from a task container, the return type of
    {@link org.ogf.saga.task.Task#getResult() getResult()} is
    {@link java.lang.Object}. If necessary, the user can associate information
    about the task with the task's UUID, and use that information to cast
    the result to the correct type. This is beyond the scope of Java generics.
